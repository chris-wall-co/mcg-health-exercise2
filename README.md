This is my submission for the MCG Health coding exercise which I was asked to complete.  The solution is written in JavaScript on the Node.JS platform using Jest for unit testing.
The exercise problem  centered around controlling a Mars Rover via a series of string commands.

Before running the tests, be sure to install dependencies:

`npm install`

To test:

`npm test`
